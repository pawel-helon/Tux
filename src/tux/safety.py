"""Static, local inspection of a proposed command for destructive patterns.

This module is a pure safety net: :func:`destructive_reason` maps a proposed
shell command string to an optional short, plain-English reason explaining why
the command is potentially destructive. It trusts nothing from the model — the
reason is derived solely from the command text — so a dangerous command is
flagged even when the model's own description says nothing about risk.

Detection deliberately favours few false positives over exhaustive coverage:
benign everyday commands (listing, navigating, reading, a plain non-recursive
delete of a named file) never trigger a warning, so the flag stays meaningful
and users do not learn to ignore it. The single public function is a natural
unit-test seam, mirroring how the model client and runner are kept testable.
