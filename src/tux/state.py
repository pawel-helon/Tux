"""Per-terminal conversation threads persisted under the XDG state directory.

Each one-shot ``tux ask`` process is short-lived, so context can only carry
across invocations if it lives on disk. tux keys a thread to the parent shell's
PID (``os.getppid()``): consecutive ``tux ask`` calls from the *same* terminal
load that shell's thread, append the new turn, and save it, while a call from a
different terminal (a different shell PID) uses its own file.

Threads live at ``$XDG_STATE_HOME/tux/threads/<ppid>.json`` (falling back to
``~/.local/state/tux/threads/<ppid>.json`` when ``XDG_STATE_HOME`` is unset).
This is *state*, not config: the endpoint/model config (see :mod:`tux.config`)
stays under ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` and is untouched here.

Because the OS eventually reuses shell PIDs, a thread is treated as fresh (an
empty history) rather than resurrected when it is stale: either older than
:data:`THREAD_TTL`, or recorded against a shell whose start time no longer
matches the PID's current start time. Any missing, empty, or corrupt file also
degrades to a fresh thread rather than raising.
