"""Read and write tux's TOML config file for the endpoint, model, variant, and system.

The config file lives at ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tux/config.toml`` (falling back to
``~/.config/tux/config.toml`` when ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is unset). It holds four optional top-level string keys: ``endpoint``, ``model``, ``variant``
(the hardware-aware capability tier), and ``system`` (the Linux environment
profile selected by provisioning). Any key absent from
the file falls back to a built-in default supplied by the caller, so a missing
file simply means "use the defaults".

Reading uses the standard-library ``tomllib``. Writing hand-formats the known
scalar keys as TOML basic strings — ``json.dumps`` produces escaping that is a
valid subset of TOML basic-string syntax and round-trips through ``tomllib``.
