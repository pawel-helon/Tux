"""Command-path request shaping and parsing for the tux model client.

This module owns the *structured command* turn: the system prompt, the strict
``json_schema`` response format that guarantees an ordered ``steps`` plan — each
step a ``{title, command, description}`` object — the parsing of that reply, and
rendering a prior plan back into a chat message for the running thread.

A command turn is answered as a step-by-step guided plan rather than a single
command: a discovery step (e.g. ``pwd``) comes before the action step that uses
its result, every step is exactly one command, and a simple lookup is a one-step
plan. A later step may carry a placeholder that a prior step's output resolves.

It is deliberately pure — it builds dicts and parses strings and knows nothing
about HTTP, streaming, or the conversational path. The transport and error
translation live in :mod:`tux.client`; the free-form path lives in
:mod:`tux.modes.chat`. Parsing problems are raised as :class:`ValueError` for the
client to translate into its public error type.
